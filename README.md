# Roman-Converter-with-simple-GUI-Javafx
This is a simple JavaFX application which gets a Roman number by input from user and converts it.
An algorithm for converting the Roman number has been written in the convertor class. This algorithm has been submitted to the LeetCode and ranked in first 15% of total accepted submission in terms of performance.
The algorithm accepts Roman number from 0 to 3999, and I know that this algorithm could be written in less lines and simpler way, but I obtained a good performance for this code.
